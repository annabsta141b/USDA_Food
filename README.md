# USDA_Food_Composition

The US Department of Agriculture publishes price estimates for fruits and vegetables online. The most recent estimates are based on a 2013 survey of US retail stores. We've cleaned and merged the fruit and vegetable price estimates for you. The result is the fresh.csv file included in the repository.

In this assignment, you'll combine the price estimates with nutrition data from the USDA Food Composition Databases, and then analyze the resulting dataset.

The USDA Food Composition Databases have a documented web API that returns data in JSON format . You need a key in order to use the API. Only 1000 requests are allowed per hour, so it's a good idea to use caching.

Sign up for an API key here (https://api.data.gov/signup/). The key will work with any data.gov API. You may need the key again later in the quarter, so make sure you save it.
